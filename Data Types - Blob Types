-- Blob Types - we use this to store large amounts of binary data like images, videos, pdf's , word files, and pretty much any binary data 
-- In MySQL we have 4 blob types and they differ based on the max amount of data they can store
-- TINYBLOB - for storing binary data upto 255bytes
-- BLOB - for storing data upto 65kb
-- MEDIUMBLOB - for storing binary data upto 16megabytes
-- LONGBLOB - for storing binary data upto 4gigabytes

-- Problems with storing files in database
-- 1. database size is going to increase pretty quickly and
-- 2. that will slow-down our backups
-- 3. we will also experience performance problems because pulling images out of our database is always slower than reading them from the dile system
-- 4. and also we have to read/write additional code to read or store images in the database
