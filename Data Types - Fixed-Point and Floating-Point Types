-- Fixed-point and Floating-point Types
-- In MySQL there are 3 types for storing numbers with a decimal point
-- 1. DECIMAL(p, s) - this is useful for storing fixed-point numbers, these are the numbers that have a fixed number of digits after the decimal point
--               when using DECIMAL type we need to supply two arguments (p - precision, s - scale)
--          precision - it specifies the maximum number of digits and this can be between 1 and 65
--          scale - it determines the number of digits after the decimal point 
--                 eg: DECIMAL(9, 2) => 1234567.89 (we can store a max of 9 digits, we have 2 digits after and 2 digits before the dec ppoint)
-- Also, the DECIMAL type has few synonyms they are :
-- DEC
-- NUMERIC
-- FIXED
-- We need to just stick with the DECIMAL and keep things consistent

-- We also have
-- FLOAT 4bytes
-- DOUBLE 8bytes
-- These are used in scientific calculations like if we want to perform calculations with very large or very small numbers, we should use these types
-- To remember : these types don't store the exact value. They use an approximation. That is the reasin they allow us to store really large or 
--               really small numbers
