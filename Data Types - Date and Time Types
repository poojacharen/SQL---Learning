-- Date and Time Types
-- In MySQL we have 4 data types for storing date and time values 
-- DATE - we can store a date without a time component
-- TIME - for storing time value
-- DATETIME 8bytes - if we want to store dates that go beyond the year 2038, we should use the DATETIME type
-- TIMESTAMP - we often use this for keeping track of when a row was inserted or last updated. We can also use DATETIME for that but the difference is the TIMESTAMP is 4bytes 
--             and we can store only dates upto the year 2038. This is called the year 2038 problem
-- YEAR - for storing a 4 digit year
