-- Indexes :
-- They are basically data structures, that database engines use to quickly find data as an anology we think of a telephone directory.
-- Using a telephone directory we can quickly find soeone else's phone number because contacts are sorted by their last and first names, this
-- way we don't have to go through every contact in the directory.
-- Database Management System use indexes to find data in a similar way. 

-- In lot of cases, indexes are small enough that they can fit into a memory. ie., why it's much faster to use them to find data, because reading data from
-- the memory is always faster than reading it from the disk. 
-- So, indexes help us find data quickly but they come with a cost
-- Cost of Indexes :
-- 1. They increase the size of the databases because they have to be permanently stored next to the tables
-- 2. Also, everytime we add, update or delete a record, MySQl has to update the corresponding indexes, and this will impact the performance of 
--    our write operations ie., it basically slows down the writes
-- For this reasons we should Reserve Indexes for performance critical queries 
-- Design indexes based on the queries not the tables
