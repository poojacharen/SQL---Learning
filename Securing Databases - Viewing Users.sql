-- Viewing Users
-- Let's see the list of users in our MySQL server, there are basically 2 ways to do
-- We have a datbase called Mysql and we have a table called user so we can select everything from this table 

SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
-- Above is the one way to view the users
-- Second way is to view through the navigator panel on the left side, Open the administration tab --> under management --> user and priveleges
