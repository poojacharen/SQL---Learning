-- Conceptual Models
-- Let's say you want to build a website for selling online course, so people can sign up and enroll in one or more courses. These are the video courses that online instructors
-- upload the course in the particular website. A course can hav one or more tags like frontend or backend. 
-- Now to create a database for this website, first we need to create a Conceptual model
-- Conceptual Model : this repesents the entities or things or concepts in this business and their relationship with each other
--                    these enitities are things like people, events locations and so on...
-- For the above situation what entities are there : student and course. So these are the concept that we need to know about in this domain
-- We need a way to visually see these entities and their relationships. There are basically 2 ways
-- 1. Entity Relationship (ER) : they are often used for data modeling
-- 2. Unified Modeling Language (UML) : it's scope goes way beyond data modeling

-- There are various tools for creating entity relationship diagrams :
-- For windows we can use Microsoft Visio and there are popular other tools like draw.io or LucidCharts
-- Refer draw.io from poojitha learning
